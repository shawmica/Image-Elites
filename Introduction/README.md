# Fungal Colony Analysis through Coconut Flesh

## Introduction

This project is centered around the analysis and documentation of fungal colony growth on coconut flesh. Coconut flesh was chosen as the primary substrate due to its high moisture content, nutrient composition, and natural sugars, which create an ideal environment for fungal colonies to thrive. The primary goal of this project was to observe and document the growth rate of black fungus on coconut flesh over a period of 14 days.

### Substrate Selection

At the onset of fungal colony growth, we experimented with various substrates, including:
- Pumpkin
- Boiled Egg
- Halved Coconut
- Bread Piece

**Final Selection:** Coconut flesh was selected as the primary substrate due to its conducive environment for fungal growth, including high moisture content and nutrient-rich composition. The natural sugars and carbohydrates present in coconut flesh serve as a food source for the fungi, promoting their growth.

## Image Acquisition

To accurately document the progression of the fungal colony, images were captured using different smartphone models, namely Google Pixel and Redmi. This approach allowed us to leverage the unique photographic capabilities of each device.

### Image Capture Details:

- **Frequency:** Three images were captured daily at approximately 6:30 am, 2:30 pm, and 8:30 pm.
- **Zoom Settings:** Google Pixel and Redmi devices were both set to a zoom value of 1.1x.
- **Lighting:** Images were captured using artificial lighting (ring light) to ensure uniform and consistent illumination, reducing shadows and uneven lighting.
- **Stability:** A tripod was used to maintain the camera's position perpendicular to the fungal colony. A white rubber sheet was used as a background to minimize distractions and enhance visibility.
- **Environment:** Images were captured in a stable location with controlled temperature and humidity.
- **File Format:** All images were saved in JPG format.
