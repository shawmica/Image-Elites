# Fungal Colony Analysis through Coconut Flesh

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the analysis and documentation of fungal colony growth on coconut flesh. The high moisture content, nutrient composition, and natural sugars in coconut meat create an ideal environment for fungal colonies to thrive. The primary goal of this project was to observe and document the growth rate of black fungus on coconut flesh over a period of 14 days.

## Substrate Selection

At the onset of fungal colony growth, we experimented with various substrates, including:
- Pumpkin
- Boiled Egg
- Halved Coconut
- Bread Piece

**Final Selection:** Coconut flesh was chosen as the primary substrate due to its conducive environment for fungal growth, including high moisture content and nutrient-rich composition. The natural sugars and carbohydrates present in the coconut flesh serve as a food source for the fungi, promoting their growth.

## Image Acquisition

To document the progression of the fungal colony, images were captured using different smartphone models, namely Google Pixel and Redmi. This allowed us to leverage the unique photographic capabilities of each device.

### Image Capture Details:
- **Frequency:** Three images were captured daily at approximately 6:30 am, 2:30 pm, and 8:30 pm.
- **Zoom Settings:** Google Pixel and Redmi devices were both set to a zoom value of 1.1x.
- **Lighting:** Images were captured using artificial lighting (ring light) to ensure uniform and consistent illumination, reducing shadows and uneven lighting.
- **Stability:** A tripod was used to maintain the camera's position perpendicular to the fungal colony. A white rubber sheet was used as a background to minimize distractions and enhance visibility.
- **Environment:** Images were captured in a stable location with controlled temperature and humidity.
- **File Format:** All images were saved in JPG format.

## Fungal Species Identification

In collaboration with a biomedical molecular biologist, we identified the common fungi likely to grow on coconut flesh:
- **Penicillium citrinum**
- **Trichoderma harzianum**
- **Hypocrea punea**

These molds often appear in shades of green, blue, or black, depending on environmental conditions.

## Project Duration

The entire process was completed over 14 days, with continuous monitoring and documentation. The collected data provides valuable insights into the growth patterns and environmental dependencies of fungal colonies on coconut flesh.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the importance of substrate selection, image acquisition techniques, and environmental control in the study of fungal colony growth. The findings contribute to a better understanding of fungal behavior in nutrient-rich environments like coconut flesh.
