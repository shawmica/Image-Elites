Report on Growth Rate Analysis of Black Fungi Colony (Hypae Penta)


Introduction

The primary objective of this study was to analyze the growth rate of the black fungi colony, Hypae Penta. To achieve this, we first segmented the samples and calculated the area of the black fungi over a series of images taken over time. This allowed us to generate a graph representing the Total Black Fungi Growth. We then proceeded to calculate the growth for three specific patches separately and determined the Average Growth Rate of the Black Fungi (Hypae Penta).

Initially, we calculated the total area of the black fungi across all samples, resulting in a graph with the X-axis representing the series of images taken over time and the Y-axis representing the number of black pixels in each sample.

Observations

•	Initial Phase (Image Index 1 to 3): No growth of black fungi was observed.
•	Middle Phase: The black fungi started to spread, but the graph fluctuated due to the invasion of green fungi into the black fungi area.
•	Later Phase: The graph showed a decline, indicating the demolition of black fungi, with fluctuations caused by the overgrowth of white fungi on the black fungi patch.

Conclusion

The Total Black Fungi Growth graph revealed significant fluctuations and interference from other fungi, leading us to conclude that this method did not provide moderate results. Hence, we decided to analyze the growth of three specific patches separately.

Growth Analysis of Individual Patches
We calculated the growth for three separate patches and generated a graph for the growth of each patch per day. This helped us derive the Average Growth Rate of Black Fungi (Hypae Penta).

Flood Fill Area of Each Sample

The graph below represents the Flood Fill Area of Each Sample, with the X-axis representing a series of images taken over time and the Y-axis measuring the flood fill area on each sample.

Observations

•	Initial Phase (Index 1 to 6): Slow increase in the number of flood-filled pixels, indicating the beginning of black fungi spread.
•	Middle Phase (Index 6 to 16): Rapid increase in growth rate, showing significant spread of black fungi with fluctuations due to green fungi invasion.
•	Later Phase (Index 15 to 27): Decline in the number of black pixels, with fluctuations caused by white fungi overgrowth.

We performed similar analyses for the other two patches and observed the following:

High peaks on image indices 19 and 25 were due to inconsistencies in the zoom value during the experimental setup.
Consistency in the experimental setup is crucial for accurate scientific results.
Area Calculations
From the calculated three graphs, we derived the area values for each patch.

Growth of Black Patch Area per Day

We generated the Growth of Black Patch Area per Day for three patches separately and observed the following:

•	No growth of black fungi until day 2.
•	Growth curve observed after day 2, with a subsequent decline due to white fungi overgrowth.
•	The white fungi had a short lifespan of approximately two days, after which the black fungi regained its area.

Our primary goal was to calculate the Average Growth Rate per Day for Black Patch Area.

Outcome

The Hypae Penta fungus exhibited a high growth rate between day 2 and day 4.
The growth rate peaked on day 4 and then started to decline.

Conclusion

The study successfully determined the growth pattern of the black fungi colony (Hypae Penta). The analysis revealed that the fungi had a significant growth phase followed by a decline due to interference from other fungi. The highest growth rate was observed between day 2 and day 4, with the peak on day 4. Consistency in the experimental setup was identified as a crucial factor for obtaining accurate results.
