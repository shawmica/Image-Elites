# Fungal Colony Analysis through Coconut Flesh

## Dataset Preparation

The images captured over the course of 14 days form the core dataset for this analysis. This dataset allows for a comprehensive study of the growth patterns of fungal colonies on coconut flesh, providing insights into how different environmental conditions affect fungal behavior.

### Sample Images

- **Google Pixel Samples:** ![Pixel photo-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53a95a84-6d54-42a0-bfc3-b287ebc51a06)
- **Redmi Samples:** ![file_2024-07-31_11 00 15](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f589c80a-d9be-479f-bbc0-31354a2ff58e)

### Fungal Species Identification

In collaboration with a biomedical molecular biologist, we identified the common fungi likely to grow on coconut flesh:
- **Penicillium citrinum**
- **Trichoderma harzianum**
- **Hypocrea punea**

These molds often appear in shades of green, blue, or black, depending on environmental conditions.

### Data Structure

- **File Naming Convention:** Each image is named according to the date and time of capture, along with the device used.
- **Metadata:** Information regarding lighting conditions, zoom settings, and environmental factors was recorded alongside each image to provide additional context for analysis.

### Data Analysis

The dataset provides valuable insights into the growth patterns and environmental dependencies of fungal colonies on coconut flesh. Researchers and analysts can use this data to study fungal behavior, image processing, and environmental effects on fungal growth.
